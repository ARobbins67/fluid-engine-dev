# Fluid Engine Dev - Jet

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/kulihlhy43vbwou6/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev/branch/master)

This project was created by Doyub Kim as part of the book, "Fluid Engine Development", and Jet is the fluid simulation engine SDK introduced from the book. Currently the book hasn't been released yet, but it will be published very soon.

## Key Features
* SPH and PCISPH fluid simulators
* Stable fluids-based smoke simulator
* Level set-based liquid simulator
* PIC and FLIP fluid simulators
* Upwind, ENO and FMM level set solvers
* Converters between signed distance function and triangular mesh

Every simulator has both 2-D and 3-D implementations.
